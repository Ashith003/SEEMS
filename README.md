# SEEMS (Student Entry and Exit Monitoring System) :
The Student Entry and Exit Monitoring System (SEEMS) is an advanced facial recognition-based solution designed to enhance security and automate the monitoring of student movements in hostel environments. Utilizing
the Haarcascade Frontalface Default classifier, SEEMS achieves over 95% accuracy in real-time identification of students, ensuring precise logging of entry and exit events with minimal false positives or
negatives.The system integrates live camera feeds with a robust database of student images, and employs temporary databases to track movements, while leveraging the Twilio API to send instant notifications to
hostel authorities, thus streamlining management and improving response times. While SEEMS demonstrates high performance, challenges such as dependence on high-quality images, controlled lighting, and stable
internet connectivity highlight areas for improvement. Future enhancements could include the adoption of 3D facial recognition techniques, offline operational capabilities, and the incorporation of multi-modal
biometric recognition to further strengthen security measures. Ethical considerations, particularly regarding data privacy and informed student consent, are critical to ensuring that SEEMS operates within legal
and ethical frameworks, maintaining transparency and trust. Overall, SEEMS represents a significant step forward in hostel security, offering a reliable, efficient, and scalable solution with substantial
potential for broader application and ongoing innovation.
